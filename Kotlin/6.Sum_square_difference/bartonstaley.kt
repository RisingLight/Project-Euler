/*
    Project Euler Question 6. Sum square difference
    
	Problem Statement: 
    
    The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

        1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
    
    The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

        (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
    
    Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
    natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

    Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
    natural numbers and the square of the sum.
